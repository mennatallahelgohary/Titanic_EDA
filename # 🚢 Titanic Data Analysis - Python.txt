# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis - Python Project

## 📁 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns related to survival based on demographics and travel class.

---

## 🧾 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- **Records:** 891 passengers
- **Features:** Name, Sex, Age, Pclass, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Cabin, Embarked, Survived

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Understand key factors affecting survival.
- Clean and prepare the dataset.
- Visualize trends using graphs.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Survival by Gender, Class, Age
- Heatmap of correlations
- Distribution of Age and Fare
- Countplot for Embarked ports

---

## 💡 Key Findings
- 👩 Females had a significantly higher survival rate.
- 🛏️ Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
- 👶 Children aged 0–10 had a higher survival rate than other age groups.

---

## 🔍 Bonus Work
- Cleaned null values using strategies like median imputation and mode.
- Created new age group features.
- Built custom visualizations with seaborn.

---

## 🧠 Learnings
- Data preprocessing and handling nulls.
- EDA best practices with visual storytelling.
- Understanding real-life implications of features.
